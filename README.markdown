# jQuery WordClock

Have you ever wanted to have a clock or timer - but using words instead of boring old numbers?

Well, this is the plugin for you! Check out the [Demo](http://loonypandora.co.uk/jQuery-WordClock/), and see for yourself.


## Getting Started

Include both jQuery and jQuery WordClock in your HTML, and call the ``wordclock`` method on a jQuery selector.

The contents of that selector will be replaced with a clock made from words.

```html
<script src="/js/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="/js/jquery.wordclock.js"></script>
<script>
  $('#my-clock').wordclock();
</script>

<div id="my-clock"></div>
```


## Dependencies

- jQuery (tested with v1.2.0 - v1.9.0)


## The Future

- Add better, more in depth documentation
- Add some default CSS styles so the first run experience is better
- Add a countdown mode, instead of constantly counting up
- Add different transition styles for a bit of variation
