# jQuery WordClock


## Getting Started

Include both jQuery and jQuery WordClock in your HTML, and call the ``wordclock`` method on a jQuery selector.

The contents of that selector will be replaced with a clock made from words.

```html
<script src="/js/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="/js/jquery.wordclock.js"></script>
<script>
  $('#my-clock').wordclock();
</script>

<div id="my-clock"></div>
```

## Dependencies

- jQuery (tested with v1.2.0 - v1.9.0)
